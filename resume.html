  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>During my school days, I started with a lot of enthusiasm, participating in many competitions and also focusing on my studies equally. I actively participated in public interactions and have tried my best to lead and understand everyone's needs. I made loyal friends who helped me by soothing out this journey of school days. During my final days at school, I started focusing on studies more to give my career a direction. In this worth remembering chapter of my life, my school has helped me a lot, supporting me at every stage. And I continue to use my learnings from school to live a fruitful life further.

  I have chosen to do my engineering from one of the most prestigious institute i.e. IIT Roorkee as I always wanted a land of opportunities, where I can really see what really excites me and I want pursue. I am person who always hunts for knowledge and wants to learn new skills all the time and tend to continue this for the rest of my journey here</p>
